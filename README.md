# Go warmup

Go is a statically typed compiled programming language, similar to C.

It has some differences to C such as memory safety, a garbage collector, and structural typing. Additionally, Go is meant for concurrency, with its motto for concurrency being:  
`Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating`

Additionally, Go is white-space significant and does not need terminating characters on each line.
